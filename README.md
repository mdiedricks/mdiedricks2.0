## General Information
This build of my personal website was bootstrapped using Frontity, a JavaScript framework designed to use Wordpress as a headless CMS.

I like being able to use Wordpress CMS for it's flexibility and plug-ins, but wanted to remain in the JS world.

Frontity uses ReactJS under the hood for rendering UI elements, with it's own libraries for querying the Wordpress API.

## Technology Used
* [Frontity](https://frontity.org/) > [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## Project Status
This project is a constant work in progress, as I adapt the layout to my liking, or to suit the evolution of the work that I do.

However, there are elements I would like to modify/add in the near future.
* Enhancements to rendering of blog elements
* Live home page elements - streaming data from a project
* Correct hover interaction on project cards (projects page)
* Formatting of projects pages to be more of a showcase
